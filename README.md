### Here’s a quick rundown of OOP in Python 🐍:

Classes & Objects 📦
Define blueprints (class) and create instances (object).

Encapsulation 🔒
Hide internal data with _ or __ prefixes and expose through methods.

Inheritance 🌳
Share code by deriving new classes from existing ones (class Child(Parent):).

Polymorphism 🔄
Use the same interface for different data types (e.g., method overriding).

Abstraction 🧩
Simplify complex reality by modeling classes with essential attributes and methods only.

That’s OOP in a nutshell! ✨
